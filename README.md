'barrc'

Intends to replace the need for writing bash scripts manually to customise bar.

C# because I wanted a simple introduction to the language prior to my final semester of university.
Bash or C would be more appropriate languages, mono is a dependency of this, which most users will have no need for.
Eventually I might create a branch with a C/sh implementation if I find the time :P.

This is a WIP, is basically broken at the moment and isn't really recommended.

I'll commit an example barrc and scriptrc until I can find the time to docment it in the wiki.
